    <h2>Ceremony</h2>
    <p>Our wedding will be held at Laura&rsquo;s parish, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir//St.+John+the+Evangelist,+21+Academy+Hill,+Watertown,+CT+06795,+United+States/@41.6022844,-73.1169319,16z/data=!4m12!1m3!3m2!1s0x0000000000000000:0x67c122f8af66b19d!2sSt.+John+the+Evangelist!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e7eacc026716b1:0x67c122f8af66b19d!2m2!1d-73.116932!2d41.602284">St. John the Evangelist</a> in Watertown, on June 27th, 2015 at 11:00 AM. I FEEL LIKE THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING ELSE HERE TO EVEN IT OUT.</p>

    <h2>Reception</h2>
    <p>Shortly after the ceremony, there will be a reception in the Virginia Hamilton Solley Hall at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/St.+John+the+Evangelist,+21+Academy+Hill,+Watertown,+CT+06795,+United+States/The+Gunnery,+Kirby+Road,+Washington,+CT/@41.6204911,-73.365615,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e7eacc026716b1:0x67c122f8af66b19d!2m2!1d-73.116932!2d41.602284!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e7f2cfe5189647:0x695b338fb58d5ef9!2m2!1d-73.310191!2d41.628968">The Gunnery</a> in Washington, about 25 minutes from Watertown. The cocktail hour will start around 1:30 PM on the patio, and the main reception will be inside, starting around 3:00 and lasting until 8:00.</p>

    <h2>Food</h2>
    <p>Hate deciding between chicken or beef? So does Brian, that's why it's a buffet! The entr&eacute;es are SOMETHING, SOMETHING, and SOMETHING, with potatoes and veggies on the side. </p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Drinks</h2>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s an open bar. We&rsquo;ll have Yuengling, Sam Adams Boston Lager, and SOMETHING? AND SOME MORE INFO ABOUT WINE, ETC.</p>
   </section>

    <h2>Accomodations</h2>
    <p>For our guests coming in from out of town, we've reserved a block of rooms at the <a href="https://resweb.passkey.com/go/f24ca250">Crowne Plaza Southbury</a>, about 20 minutes from both Watertown and Washington.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;d prefer something a little more rustic, we&rsquo;d also recommend the <a href="http://www.litchfieldinnct.com/">Litchfield Inn</a>, or the <a href="http://www.curtishouseinn.com/">Curtis House</a> in Woodbury.

    <h2>Parking</h2>
    <p>At the church: enter the shared driveway between St. John&rsquo;s and the Rite-Aid (on the left side of the church), and follow the driveway around the back of the church to enter the parking lot.</p>
    <p>At The Gunnery: WE PROBABLY NEED A PICTURE HERE?</p>

    <h2>Photography</h2>
    <p>We ask that you experience our wedding fully, and not just through the viewfinder on your camera. Feel free to take a few pictures, of course, but if Brian catches you standing on a pew for a better view, he may stop the ceremony to scold you. We have a fantastic photographer coming, and we&rsquo;ll be sure to send the pictures to everyone when they&rsquo;re ready. ALSO, DON&rsquo;T POST THINGS TO FACEBOOK.</p>
