    <h2>Food</h2>
    <p>Hate deciding between chicken or beef? So does Brian, that's why it's a buffet! The entr&eacute;es are SOMETHING, SOMETHING, and SOMETHING, with potatoes and veggies on the side. </p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Drinks</h2>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s an open bar. We&rsquo;ll have Yuengling, Sam Adams Boston Lager, and SOMETHING? AND SOME MORE INFO ABOUT WINE, ETC.</p>

    <h2>Accomodations</h2>
    <p>For our guests coming in from out of town, we've reserved a block of rooms at the <a href="http://www.ihg.com/crowneplaza/hotels/us/en/southbury/hvnsb/hoteldetail">Crowne Plaza Southbury</a>, about 20 minutes from both Watertown and Washington.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;d prefer something a little more rustic, we&rsquo;d also recommend the <a href="http://www.litchfieldinnct.com/">Litchfield Inn</a>, or the <a href="http://www.curtishouseinn.com/">Curtis House</a> in Woodbury.

    <h2>Parking</h2>
    <p>At the church: enter the shared driveway between St. John&rsquo;s and the Rite-Aid (on the left side of the church), and follow the driveway around the back of the church to enter the parking lot.</p>
    <p>At The Gunnery: WE PROBABLY NEED A PICTURE HERE?</p>

    <h2>Photography</h2>
    <p>We ask that you experience our wedding fully, and not just through the viewfinder on your camera. Feel free to take a few pictures, of course, but if Brian catches you standing on a pew for a better view, he may stop the ceremony to scold you. We have a fantastic photographer coming, and we&rsquo;ll be sure to send the pictures to everyone when they&rsquo;re ready. ALSO, DON&rsquo;T POST THINGS TO FACEBOOK.</p>
